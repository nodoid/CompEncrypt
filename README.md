# CompEncrypt

A .NET MAUI example of how to take an image from the Resources directory then do the following

1. Convert to Base64
2. Encrypt the file
3. Compress 
4. Decompress
5. Decrypt
6. Convert back from Base64 and display the original image

This was created using the GA2 release of .NET MAUI so may contain bugs from this version (notably the #if required around the iOS and Android code)

Code released under the DILLIGAF licence and may or may not appear in my forthcoming .NET MAUI book
